We all know the importance of setting goals -- they hold you accountable, tell you what you truly want and help propel you forward. Whether the goals are professional or personal, many of us simply state our goals but fail to set deadlines and track our progress toward achieving them.

Goal Tracker is an comprehensive solution that lets you setup your team and individual goals from right inside Microsoft Teams, update and share the progress of goals, and integrate seamlessly with existing channels and teams.

As a team member, this app template can be utilized to set your personal goals, update progress and importantly, save notes directly from Teams or any other application as a link so that you don't have to scramble to get the evidence of work done, praises that you got for your work or anything relevant for any review! 
As a manager, you can set your teams goals in addition to your personal goals. Team members can align their personal goals to team goals. A simple bot command can help you to view the progress against your team goals. Team goal progress is automatically updated according to the updates on personal goals by your team members. Additionally, this Microsoft Teams app also notifies your entire team to update progress as per the frequency selected and maintains the history of your goals up to 1 year.
